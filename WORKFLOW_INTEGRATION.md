```

### 5. Completion Phase Integration

**Primary Commands**: `/commit`, `/docs`, `/contributing`

**Prerequisites**:
- Validated implementation

**Natural Next Steps**:
- `/retrospective` - To analyze completed feature
- `/feature-status` - To update project status

## State Sharing Between Commands

### Requirements ‚Üí Plan Integration
```javascript
// plan command checks for requirements
const requirementsPath = 'requirements/plan.md';
if (await fileExists(requirementsPath)) {
  const requirements = await readRequirements(requirementsPath);
  // Use requirements to inform planning decisions
}
```

### Plan ‚Üí Implementation Integration
```javascript
// implement command can reference plan
const planPath = 'plan/plan.md';
if (await fileExists(planPath)) {
  const plan = await readPlan(planPath);
  // Use plan to guide implementation approach
}
```

### Implementation ‚Üí Validation Integration
```javascript
// validate-implementation references both requirements and plan
const requirementsPath = 'requirements/plan.md';
const planPath = 'plan/plan.md';
const requirements = await readRequirements(requirementsPath);
const plan = await readPlan(planPath);
// Compare implementation against both documents
```

## Workflow Suggestions Logic

### Context-Aware Suggestions

Each command includes logic to suggest relevant next steps based on:

1. **Current Phase**: Where in the development lifecycle
2. **Available Artifacts**: What documents/files exist
3. **Command History**: What commands were recently used
4. **Project State**: Current implementation status

### Example Suggestion Logic

```markdown
## Command Integration

When appropriate, I may suggest using other commands:
- `/test` - After major implementation changes
- `/commit` - At logical checkpoints in the development process
- `/review` - For code quality assurance
- `/security-scan` - For security validation
```

## Multi-Feature Project Management

### Feature Status Dashboard Integration

The `/feature-status` command provides project-wide visibility:

```markdown
## Feature Status Summary

### üü¢ Completed Features (Ready for Deployment)
| Feature | Requirements | Planning | Implementation | Validation | Deployment |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------------|------------|------------|
| User Authentication | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Complete | üü° Pending |

### üü° In Progress Features
| Feature | Requirements | Planning | Implementation | Validation | Deployment |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------------|------------|------------|
| User Profile | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Complete | üü° In Progress | ‚ùå Not Started | ‚ùå Not Started |
```

### Cross-Feature Learning

The `/retrospective` command analyzes patterns across multiple features:

```markdown
## Trend Analysis Across Features

### Common Bottlenecks
1. **Requirements Phase**: Stakeholder availability (affects 60% of features)
2. **Implementation Phase**: API integration complexity (affects 40% of features)
3. **Validation Phase**: Test environment setup (affects 30% of features)

### Process Improvements
1. **Buffer Time**: Add 25% buffer for integration work
2. **Stakeholder Management**: Secure dedicated time commitments upfront
3. **Environment Preparation**: Set up deployment pipeline during planning
```

## Integration with Existing CCPlugins Commands

### Enhanced Command Suggestions

The new planning commands intelligently suggest existing CCPlugins commands:

**During Requirements**:
- `/understand` - For codebase analysis

**During Planning**:
- `/scaffold` - For implementation structure

**During Implementation**:
- `/implement` - For complex feature development
- `/test` - For validation
- `/review` - For quality assurance

**During Validation**:
- `/security-scan` - For security issues
- `/predict-issues` - For proactive problem detection

**After Completion**:
- `/commit` - For saving work
- `/docs` - For documentation updates
- `/contributing` - For deployment preparation

### Workflow Documentation Integration

Commands automatically update relevant documentation:

1. **Requirements** ‚Üí Update project README with feature descriptions
2. **ADR** ‚Üí Maintain architecture decision knowledge base
3. **Retrospective** ‚Üí Update team playbooks and best practices
4. **Feature Status** ‚Üí Provide project dashboards and reports

## Command Chaining Examples

### New Feature Development
```bash
# Complete workflow for new feature
claude "/requirements UserProfile"
claude "/plan UserProfile"
claude "/scaffold user-profile"
claude "/implement"
claude "/expand-tests UserProfile"
claude "/test"
claude "/validate-implementation UserProfile"
claude "/review"
claude "/commit"
claude "/retrospective UserProfile"
```

### Pattern Expansion
```bash
# Expand existing patterns
claude "/expand-api users"        # Create similar API endpoints
claude "/expand-components Button" # Create similar UI components
claude "/expand-models User"      # Create related data models
claude "/expand-tests"            # Add comprehensive test coverage
claude "/test"
claude "/review"
claude "/commit"
```

### Project Management
```bash
# Project oversight and management
claude "/feature-status"          # Check overall project status
claude "/adr 'Database Choice'"   # Document architectural decisions
claude "/retrospective"           # Analyze completed features
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Command Dependency Validation

Commands validate prerequisites and provide helpful guidance:

```markdown
**Note:** If no requirements exist, I'll suggest running `/requirements` first

**Prerequisites Validation:**
- Verify requirements document exists and is complete
- Check implementation plan exists with defined tasks
- Ensure current implementation is available for analysis
```

### Graceful Degradation

Commands work independently when possible:

- `/plan` can work without requirements (with warnings)
- `/validate-implementation` can work with partial documentation
- `/retrospective` can analyze available artifacts even if incomplete

### Recovery Suggestions

When commands detect issues, they suggest recovery actions:

```markdown
**Integration Failures:**
- **Missing Requirements**: Prompt to create requirements before planning
- **Broken References**: Auto-repair with user notification
- **Command Conflicts**: Clear precedence rules and conflict resolution
```

This integration system ensures that the planning enhancement commands work seamlessly together and with existing CCPlugins commands, creating a cohesive development workflow that guides users naturally from idea to deployment.
