# Security and Safety Measures Guide

## Overview

CCPlugins planning enhancement commands implement comprehensive security and safety measures to protect user data, maintain system integrity, and ensure safe operation in all environments.

## Security Principles

### 1. No AI Attribution Policy

**Strict Policy**: All commands NEVER add AI attribution to any output.

**Prohibited Actions**:
- Adding "Co-authored-by: Claude" or similar signatures
- Including "Generated with Claude Code" messages
- Adding AI attribution to commits, issues, or documentation
- Modifying git config to include AI information
- Adding watermarks or signatures to generated code

**Implementation in Commands**:
```markdown
**Important**: I will NEVER:
- Add "Co-authored-by" or any Claude signatures to commits
- Include "Generated with Claude Code" in any output
- Modify git config or repository settings
- Add any AI/assistant signatures or watermarks
- Use emojis in commits, PRs, issues, or git-related content
```

### 2. Git Safety Measures

**Git Checkpoint Creation**:
All commands that modify files create safety checkpoints:

```bash
# Safety checkpoint before destructive operations
git add -A
git commit -m "Pre-operation checkpoint" || echo "No changes to commit"
```

**Protected Operations**:
- File modifications and deletions
- Directory structure changes
- Configuration updates
- Code generation and refactoring

**Rollback Capabilities**:
- Automatic checkpoint creation before changes
- Clear rollback instructions in error messages
- Preservation of original state for recovery
- Safe operation cancellation at any point

### 3. Data Protection

**Sensitive Information Handling**:
- No credentials or secrets stored in state files
- Environment variables and configuration files excluded from analysis
- Personal information filtered from examples and documentation
- API keys and tokens never logged or stored

**PII Protection**:
- Automatic detection and filtering of personal information
- Generic placeholders used in examples ([name], [email], [phone])
- No user-specific data stored in session files
- Clear data retention and cleanup policies

**Example Implementation**:
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for PII filtering
function filterSensitiveData(content) {
  return content
    .replace(/\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b/g, '[email]')
    .replace(/\b\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}\b/g, '[phone]')
    .replace(/\b[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+\b/g, '[name]')
    .replace(/\b(?:sk|pk)_[a-zA-Z0-9]+/g, '[api_key]');
}
```

### 4. Access Control

**File System Permissions**:
- Respect existing file permissions and ownership
- Never modify system or protected files
- Operate only within project boundaries
- Clear error messages for permission issues

**Directory Boundaries**:
- All operations confined to project directory
- No access to parent directories or system paths
- Session files stored within project structure
- Clear validation of file paths and operations

**Permission Validation**:
```markdown
**Access Control Checks**:
- Verify read/write permissions before operations
- Respect file system boundaries and restrictions
- Provide clear error messages for access issues
- Never attempt to escalate privileges
```

## Safety Measures

### 1. Safe File Operations

**Atomic Operations**:
- Use temporary files for complex operations
- Atomic writes to prevent corruption
- Rollback capability for failed operations
- Validation before committing changes

**File Backup Strategy**:
```markdown
**Backup Procedures**:
1. **Pre-operation Backup**: Create backup before modifications
2. **Incremental Backups**: Save intermediate states during long operations
3. **Recovery Points**: Clear recovery points for rollback
4. **Cleanup Policy**: Automatic cleanup of old backups
```

**Safe File Handling**:
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for safe file operations
async function safeFileWrite(filePath, content) {
  const tempPath = `${filePath}.tmp`;
  const backupPath = `${filePath}.backup`;
  
  try {
    // Create backup if file exists
    if (await fileExists(filePath)) {
      await copyFile(filePath, backupPath);
    }
    
    // Write to temporary file
    await writeFile(tempPath, content);
    
    // Atomic move to final location
    await moveFile(tempPath, filePath);
    
    // Clean up backup after successful operation
    await deleteFile(backupPath);
    
  } catch (error) {
    // Restore from backup on failure
    if (await fileExists(backupPath)) {
      await moveFile(backupPath, filePath);
    }
    
    // Clean up temporary file
    await deleteFile(tempPath);
    
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### 2. Session State Protection

**State File Integrity**:
- JSON schema validation for state files
- Corruption detection and recovery
- Atomic updates to prevent partial writes
- Backup and recovery mechanisms

**Session Isolation**:
- Each command maintains separate session state
- No cross-session data contamination
- Clear session boundaries and cleanup
- Safe concurrent session handling

**State Validation**:
```markdown
**State Integrity Checks**:
- Schema validation on state file load
- Corruption detection with automatic recovery
- Version compatibility checks and migration
- Consistency validation across related files
```

### 3. Error Handling Safety

**Graceful Degradation**:
- Continue operation with reduced functionality when possible
- Clear communication of limitations and impacts
- Safe fallback modes for critical operations
- No data loss during error conditions

**Error Recovery**:
- Automatic recovery from common error conditions
- Clear recovery procedures for manual intervention
- Preservation of user work during failures
- Safe operation cancellation and cleanup

**Error Reporting**:
```markdown
**Safe Error Reporting**:
- No sensitive information in error messages
- Clear, actionable error descriptions
- Safe recovery suggestions and procedures
- Proper error logging without data exposure
```

### 4. Resource Management

**Memory Safety**:
- Memory usage monitoring and limits
- Automatic cleanup of unused resources
- Prevention of memory leaks in long operations
- Safe handling of large files and datasets

**Disk Space Management**:
- Disk space checks before large operations
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files
- Clear warnings for low disk space conditions
- Safe operation cancellation when space limited

**Process Safety**:
```markdown
**Resource Protection**:
- CPU usage monitoring for long operations
- Automatic throttling for system protection
- Safe cancellation of resource-intensive operations
- Clear progress reporting and user control
```

## Security Validation

### 1. Input Validation

**Command Input Validation**:
- Sanitization of all user inputs
- Path traversal prevention
- Command injection prevention
- Safe handling of special characters

**File Path Validation**:
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for path validation
function validatePath(inputPath) {
  // Prevent path traversal
  if (inputPath.includes('..') || inputPath.includes('~')) {
    throw new Error('Invalid path: path traversal not allowed');
  }
  
  // Ensure path is within project directory
  const resolvedPath = path.resolve(inputPath);
  const projectRoot = path.resolve('.');
  
  if (!resolvedPath.startsWith(projectRoot)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid path: outside project directory');
  }
  
  return resolvedPath;
}
```

### 2. Content Sanitization

**Code Generation Safety**:
- No execution of generated code during analysis
- Safe parsing and analysis of code content
- Prevention of code injection in templates
- Validation of generated code syntax

**Template Safety**:
```markdown
**Template Security**:
- No dynamic code execution in templates
- Safe variable substitution and escaping
- Validation of template syntax and structure
- Prevention of template injection attacks
```

### 3. External Integration Security

**Tool Integration Safety**:
- Validation of tool outputs and responses
- Safe handling of external tool failures
- No execution of untrusted external commands
- Clear boundaries for external tool access

**Network Security**:
- No unauthorized network requests
- Safe handling of network failures and timeouts
- Validation of external data sources
- Clear user consent for any external access
