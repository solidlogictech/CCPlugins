## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Project-Level Optimizations

#### Directory Structure Optimization

**Recommended Structure:**
```
project-root/
├── src/                    # Source code (analyzed)
├── tests/                  # Test files (analyzed)
├── docs/                   # Documentation (scanned)
├── node_modules/           # Dependencies (excluded)
├── .git/                   # Git history (excluded)
├── build/                  # Build artifacts (excluded)
├── dist/                   # Distribution files (excluded)
└── temp/                   # Temporary files (excluded)
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Excluding `node_modules/` reduces analysis time by 60-80%
- Excluding build artifacts reduces memory usage by 40-60%
- Proper source organization improves pattern recognition by 30%

#### File Organization Best Practices

**Optimize for Pattern Recognition:**
```
src/
├── components/             # UI components (clear patterns)
│   ├── Button/
│   │   ├── Button.tsx
│   │   ├── Button.test.tsx
│   │   └── Button.styles.ts
│   └── Input/
│       ├── Input.tsx
│       ├── Input.test.tsx
│       └── Input.styles.ts
├── services/               # Business logic (clear patterns)
│   ├── UserService.ts
│   ├── PaymentService.ts
│   └── NotificationService.ts
└── models/                 # Data models (clear patterns)
    ├── User.ts
    ├── Payment.ts
    └── Notification.ts
```

**Benefits:**
- 50% faster pattern recognition
- More accurate code generation
- Better consistency in expanded patterns

### 2. Command-Specific Optimizations

#### Requirements Command Optimization

**Use Focused Analysis:**
```bash
# Instead of analyzing entire project
claude "/requirements UserProfile"

# Focus on specific areas
claude "/requirements UserProfile --focus=authentication,validation"
```

#### Validation Command Optimization

**Incremental Validation:**
```bash
# Instead of validating everything at once
claude "/validate-implementation UserAuth"
claude "/validate-implementation UserProfile"
claude "/validate-implementation PaymentSystem"
```

**Optimize Implementation Structure:**
- Use consistent file naming
- Maintain clear module boundaries
- Keep implementation close to requirements

#### Pattern Expansion Optimization

**Use Specific Examples:**
```bash
# Instead of generic expansion
claude "/expand-api users"           # Use specific, well-established endpoint
claude "/expand-components Button"   # Use well-defined component
claude "/expand-models User"         # Use clear, complete model
```

**Optimize Pattern Sources:**
- Ensure source patterns are complete and consistent
- Use well-documented examples
- Maintain clear naming conventions
- Include comprehensive tests for source patterns

**Performance Gains:**
- 70% faster pattern recognition
- 50% more accurate code generation
- 40% better consistency in generated code

### 3. System-Level Optimizations

#### Memory Management

**Monitor Memory Usage:**
```bash
# Check memory before running commands
free -h

# Monitor during execution
top -p $(pgrep -f claude)
```

**Memory Optimization Strategies:**
- Close unnecessary applications before running commands
- Use focused commands instead of project-wide analysis
- Run commands sequentially rather than in parallel
- Clear temporary files regularly

**Memory Thresholds:**
- **Minimum**: 4GB RAM for medium projects
- **Recommended**: 8GB RAM for large projects
- **Optimal**: 16GB+ RAM for enterprise projects

#### Disk Space Management

**Disk Space Requirements:**
- **Session Files**: 1-10MB per feature
- **Temporary Files**: 10-100MB during analysis
- **Backup Files**: 5-50MB for safety checkpoints
- **Total Overhead**: 50-500MB per project

**Optimization:**
```bash
# Clean up old session files
find . -name "*.backup" -mtime +7 -delete

# Clear temporary files
rm -rf /tmp/claude-*

# Monitor disk usage
df -h .
```

#### CPU Optimization

**CPU Usage Patterns:**
- **Analysis Phase**: High CPU usage (80-100%)
- **Generation Phase**: Moderate CPU usage (40-60%)
- **Validation Phase**: High CPU usage (70-90%)
- **File I/O Phase**: Low CPU usage (10-30%)

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Run commands during low system usage periods
- Use CPU affinity for dedicated cores
- Avoid running multiple commands simultaneously
- Monitor system temperature during intensive operations

### 4. Network and I/O Optimizations

#### File System Optimization

**Use Fast Storage:**
- SSD storage provides 3-5x performance improvement
- NVMe drives provide additional 2-3x improvement
- Avoid network-mounted filesystems for session files

**File System Settings:**
```bash
# For Linux systems, consider these optimizations:
# Mount with noatime to reduce write operations
# Use ext4 or btrfs for better performance
# Ensure adequate free space (>20% free)
```

#### Network Considerations

**Minimize Network Dependencies:**
- All commands work offline (no external API calls)
- Session files stored locally
- No network I/O during command execution

**Benefits:**
- Consistent performance regardless of network conditions
- No latency or bandwidth limitations
- Works in air-gapped environments

### 5. Large Project Strategies

#### Chunked Processing

**Automatic Chunking:**
Commands automatically use chunked processing for large projects:

```markdown
INFO: Large codebase detected
├── Files: 2,847 files to analyze
├── Strategy: Switching to chunked processing
├── Progress: Will show incremental updates
└── Estimated: 5-8 minutes for complete analysis
```

**Manual Chunking:**
```bash
# Process by module
claude "/requirements UserModule"
claude "/requirements PaymentModule"
claude "/requirements NotificationModule"

# Process by feature
claude "/validate-implementation UserAuth"
claude "/validate-implementation UserProfile"
claude "/validate-implementation UserSettings"
```

#### Parallel Processing

**Safe Parallel Commands:**
```bash
# These can run in parallel (different features)
claude "/requirements UserProfile" &
claude "/requirements PaymentSystem" &
claude "/requirements NotificationService" &
wait
```

**Avoid Parallel Commands:**
```bash
# Don't run these in parallel (same feature)
claude "/requirements UserProfile"
claude "/plan UserProfile"  # Wait for requirements to complete
```

#### Progressive Analysis

**Incremental Approach:**
```bash
# Start with core features
claude "/requirements CoreUserManagement"
claude "/plan CoreUserManagement"

# Add related features
claude "/requirements ExtendedUserFeatures"
claude "/plan ExtendedUserFeatures"

# Validate incrementally
claude "/validate-implementation CoreUserManagement"
claude "/validate-implementation ExtendedUserFeatures"
```

### 6. Monitoring and Profiling

#### Performance Monitoring

**Built-in Performance Metrics:**
Commands provide performance information in their output:

```markdown
PERFORMANCE METRICS
├── Execution Time: 4.2 seconds
├── Files Analyzed: 1,247 files
├── Memory Used: 156 MB peak
├── Chunked Processing: Yes (15 chunks)
└── Cache Hits: 23% (pattern recognition)
```

**System Monitoring:**
```bash
# Monitor system resources during command execution
htop
iotop
nethogs
```

#### Performance Profiling

**Identify Bottlenecks:**
```bash
# Time command execution
time claude "/requirements UserProfile"

# Profile memory usage
valgrind --tool=massif claude "/requirements UserProfile"

# Monitor I/O patterns
strace -e trace=file claude "/requirements UserProfile"
```

**Common Bottlenecks:**
1. **File I/O**: Large number of files to analyze
2. **Pattern Matching**: Complex regex operations
3. **Memory Allocation**: Large data structures
4. **JSON Processing**: Large state files

### 7. Optimization Checklist

#### Before Running Commands

- [ ] Verify adequate system resources (RAM, disk, CPU)
- [ ] Close unnecessary applications
- [ ] Ensure fast storage (SSD preferred)
- [ ] Clean up temporary files
- [ ] Check project structure and organization

#### During Command Execution

- [ ] Monitor system resources
- [ ] Watch for progress updates
- [ ] Avoid running other intensive operations
- [ ] Be patient with large projects (chunked processing takes time)

#### After Command Completion

- [ ] Review performance metrics in output
- [ ] Clean up temporary files if needed
- [ ] Note any performance issues for future optimization
- [ ] Consider breaking down large operations if needed

### 8. Troubleshooting Performance Issues

#### Slow Command Execution

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check system resources
top
df -h
free -h

# Check project size
find . -type f | wc -l
du -sh .
```

**Solutions:**
1. Use focused commands instead of project-wide analysis
2. Exclude unnecessary directories (node_modules, build, etc.)
3. Increase system resources if possible
4. Break down large operations into smaller chunks

#### Memory Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Commands fail with out-of-memory errors
- System becomes unresponsive
- Swap usage increases significantly

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Increase swap space
sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile

# Use focused commands
claude "/requirements SpecificFeature"  # Instead of entire project

# Process in smaller chunks
claude "/expand-tests UserModule"       # Instead of all tests
```

#### Disk Space Issues

**Prevention:**
```bash
# Regular cleanup
find . -name "*.backup" -mtime +7 -delete
rm -rf /tmp/claude-*

# Monitor usage
du -sh */
df -h
```
