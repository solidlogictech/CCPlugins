## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Extended Thinking Mode:**
  - Added to `/refactor` for complex architectural refactoring analysis
  - Added to `/security-scan` for sophisticated vulnerability detection
  - Triggers on complex scenarios requiring deep analysis

- **Minimal Command Orchestration:**
  - `/implement` suggests `/test` and `/commit` after milestones
  - `/refactor` suggests `/test` and `/commit` at logical checkpoints
  - `/security-scan` suggests `/test` and `/commit` for critical fixes
  - `/fix-todos` suggests `/test` and `/commit` after resolving critical TODOs
  - Pragmatic integration without over-engineering

### Removed
- `/human-mode` command - Functionality was redundant with Claude's natural adaptability

## [2.5.2] - 2025-08-02

### Added
- **Session Persistence for Complex Commands:**
  - `/implement`, `/refactor`, `/fix-todos`, `/scaffold`, `/security-scan`, `/fix-imports` now maintain state across Claude sessions
  - Session files stored in command-specific folders for better organization
  - Auto-resume capabilities with progress tracking and statistics
  - Intelligent plan creation before execution to ensure consistency

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
  - All commands now work on Windows, Linux, and macOS
  - Replaced shell-specific commands with Claude native tools
  - Path handling uses forward slashes for universal compatibility
  - Removed dependencies on bash-specific features

### Enhanced
- **Command Improvements:**
  - Reduced verbosity while maintaining clarity (73% reduction in `/implement`, 56% in `/refactor`)
  - Added mandatory plan creation before execution in complex commands
  - Improved error handling and recovery strategies
  - Better integration between related commands

- **Documentation:**
  - Added continuous development notice highlighting active maintenance
  - Enhanced architecture description with visual flow diagrams
  - Added developer mood emojis to problem statements
  - Improved high-level technical documentation

- **Git Safety:**
  - Added explicit AI attribution prevention to all git-related commands
  - Ensures no "Co-authored-by" or AI signatures in commits
  - Protects user ownership of all code changes

### Fixed
- **Critical Path Resolution Fix:**
  - Fixed Claude LS tool not recognizing hidden folders starting with dot (.)
  - Changed from hidden `.claude/` folder to visible command-specific folders
  - Each command now creates its own folder: `refactor/`, `implement/`, `fix-imports/`, `security-scan/`, `scaffold/`
  - Resolved issue where Claude would fail to find existing session files and create duplicate folders
  - Commands now correctly resume sessions without path confusion
- Session files now save in project directory instead of global Claude installation
- Fixed Claude interpreting relative paths incorrectly (was looking in parent directories)
- Removed shell command dependencies for Windows compatibility
- Corrected session persistence logic to always create plans first
