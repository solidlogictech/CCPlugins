# Design Document

## Overview

This design extends CCPlugins with strategic planning commands and pattern expansion capabilities that complement the existing tactical execution commands. The enhancement adds nine new commands (`/requirements`, `/plan`, `/validate-implementation`, `/adr`, `/feature-status`, `/retrospective`, `/expand-tests`, `/expand-api`, `/expand-components`, `/expand-models`) that create a complete development workflow from idea conception to post-deployment learning, plus intelligent pattern expansion for scaling existing functionality.

The design follows CCPlugins' established patterns: conversational first-person instructions, session continuity through local state files, native tool integration, and safety-first approaches with git checkpoints.

## Architecture

### Core Design Principles

**Conversational Interface**: All new commands use first-person collaborative language ("I'll help you gather requirements...") to activate Claude's collaborative reasoning, consistent with existing CCPlugins design.

**Session Continuity**: Each command maintains state through local folders in the project directory, following the established pattern:
- `{command-name}/plan.md` - Human-readable progress and decisions
- `{command-name}/state.json` - Machine-readable state for resumption

**Native Tool Integration**: Commands leverage Claude Code CLI's native capabilities:
- **Grep** for pattern matching and analysis
- **Read** for content analysis and context building
- **Write** for file creation and updates
- **Glob** for project structure discovery

**Safety-First Design**: Git checkpoints before destructive operations, rollback capabilities, and no AI attribution in commits.

### Command Architecture

Each planning command follows a consistent five-phase architecture:

1. **Session Setup & Analysis** - Check for existing sessions, analyze project context
2. **Strategic Planning** - Create structured plans based on analysis
3. **Incremental Execution** - Apply changes systematically with validation
4. **Quality Assurance** - Validate completeness and integration
5. **Context Continuity** - Maintain state for future sessions

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Requirements Management Component (`/requirements`)

**Purpose**: Gather and document feature requirements using industry-standard formats.

**Session Files**:
- `requirements/plan.md` - Requirements document with user stories and acceptance criteria

## Error Handling

### Session Recovery
- **Corrupted State Files**: Regenerate from plan.md content with user confirmation
- **Missing Dependencies**: Graceful degradation with clear error messages
- **Version Conflicts**: State migration with backup preservation

### Integration Failures
- **Missing Requirements**: Prompt to create requirements before planning
- **Broken References**: Auto-repair with user notification
- **Command Conflicts**: Clear precedence rules and conflict resolution

### Validation Errors
- **Incomplete Analysis**: Partial results with clear limitations
- **Access Restrictions**: Skip protected files with notification
- **Performance Issues**: Chunked processing for large codebases

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach
Each command component will be tested through:
- **Instruction Validation**: Verify command instructions produce expected behavior
- **State Management**: Test session continuity and recovery
- **Integration Points**: Validate interactions with existing commands

### Integration Testing
- **Workflow Testing**: Complete feature lifecycle from requirements to retrospective
- **Command Chaining**: Verify suggestions and integrations work correctly
- **Cross-Session Testing**: Validate state persistence and recovery

### User Acceptance Testing
- **Developer Workflow**: Real-world feature development scenarios
- **Performance Testing**: Large codebase handling and response times
- **Usability Testing**: Command discoverability and ease of use

### Test Data Strategy
- **Sample Projects**: Multiple technology stacks and project sizes
- **Edge Cases**: Corrupted states, missing files, permission issues
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Response time and memory usage baselines

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Requirements & Planning)
- Implement `/requirements` command with EARS format support
- Implement `/plan` command with architecture analysis
- Establish session management patterns
- Create basic integration with existing commands

### Phase 2: Validation & Decision Recording (Implementation Validation & ADR)

## Integration with Existing Commands

### Command Suggestions
The new planning commands will intelligently suggest existing CCPlugins commands at appropriate workflow points:

**During Requirements**: Suggest `/understand` for codebase analysis
**During Planning**: Suggest `/scaffold` for implementation structure
**During Implementation**: Suggest `/implement`, `/test`, `/review`
**During Validation**: Suggest `/security-scan`, `/predict-issues`
**After Completion**: Suggest `/commit`, `/docs`, `/contributing`

### State Sharing
Commands will share relevant state information:
- Requirements inform planning decisions
- Plans guide implementation validation
- ADRs provide context for future decisions
- Retrospectives update team knowledge

### Workflow Integration
Natural progression between commands:
```
/requirements → /plan → /scaffold → /implement → /test → 
/validate-implementation → /commit → /retrospective
```

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability
- **Large Codebases**: Chunked analysis with progress indicators
- **Multiple Features**: Efficient state management and caching
- **Long Sessions**: Memory optimization and cleanup

### Response Time
- **Quick Commands**: Sub-second response for status checks
- **Analysis Commands**: Progress indicators for longer operations
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking operations where possible

### Resource Usage
- **Memory Management**: Efficient state serialization and cleanup
- **Disk Usage**: Compressed state files and cleanup policies
- **Network Usage**: Minimal external dependencies

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Sensitive Information**: No credentials or secrets in state files
- **Access Control**: Respect existing file permissions
- **Audit Trail**: Clear logging without sensitive data exposure

### Git Integration
- **No AI Attribution**: Maintain existing CCPlugins policy
- **Safe Operations**: Git checkpoints before destructive changes
- **Clean History**: Meaningful commit messages without AI signatures

### State File Security
- **Local Storage**: All state files remain in project directory
- **No External Transmission**: State never leaves local environment
- **Cleanup Policies**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files
