# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CCPlugins currently provides 24 professional commands for Claude Code CLI that automate development workflows, saving developers 2-3 hours per week. However, there are gaps in the early stages of the software development lifecycle, particularly around requirements gathering, feature planning, implementation planning, and post-implementation validation. This enhancement will add strategic planning commands that complement the existing tactical execution commands, creating a complete development workflow from idea to deployment.

1. WHEN I run `/plan [feature-name]` THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive implementation plan based on existing requirements
2. WHEN creating plans THEN the system SHALL analyze project architecture to suggest appropriate implementation approaches
3. WHEN planning features THEN the system SHALL break work into testable, incremental tasks with clear dependencies
4. WHEN generating plans THEN the system SHALL estimate effort and identify potential risks
5. IF no requirements exist THEN the system SHALL prompt me to create requirements first
6. WHEN plans are created THEN the system SHALL include validation checkpoints and testing strategies

### Requirement 3: Implementation Validation Command

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want a command to validate that my implementation matches the original requirements and plan, so that I can ensure feature completeness and quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `/validate-implementation [feature-name]` THEN the system SHALL compare current implementation against original requirements
2. WHEN validating implementation THEN the system SHALL check that all acceptance criteria are met
3. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL identify missing features, incomplete implementations, or deviations from plan
4. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL generate a completeness report with specific gaps and recommendations
5. IF implementation is incomplete THEN the system SHALL create actionable tasks to address gaps
6. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL suggest next steps like documentation updates or deployment preparation

### Requirement 4: Architecture Decision Recording

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want a command to document architectural decisions made during development, so that future developers understand the reasoning behind design choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `/adr [decision-title]` THEN the system SHALL create an Architecture Decision Record following standard ADR format
2. WHEN creating ADRs THEN the system SHALL analyze current codebase to understand context and existing patterns
3. WHEN documenting decisions THEN the system SHALL include status, context, decision, and consequences sections
4. WHEN ADRs are created THEN the system SHALL link them to related requirements and implementation tasks
5. IF similar decisions exist THEN the system SHALL reference previous ADRs and highlight differences

### Requirement 5: Feature Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want a command to track the complete lifecycle of features from requirements to deployment, so that I can maintain visibility into project progress and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `/feature-status [feature-name]` THEN the system SHALL show the current status across all lifecycle phases
2. WHEN tracking features THEN the system SHALL maintain state across requirements, planning, implementation, and validation phases
3. WHEN showing status THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks and suggest next actions
4. WHEN features are complete THEN the system SHALL generate deployment readiness checklists
5. IF multiple features exist THEN the system SHALL provide project-wide status dashboard

### Requirement 6: Retrospective and Learning Command

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want a command to conduct retrospectives on completed features, so that I can learn from successes and failures to improve future development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `/retrospective [feature-name]` THEN the system SHALL analyze the complete development lifecycle for lessons learned
2. WHEN conducting retrospectives THEN the system SHALL compare actual vs planned effort, timeline, and scope
3. WHEN analyzing completed work THEN the system SHALL identify patterns in requirements changes, implementation challenges, and quality issues
4. WHEN retrospectives complete THEN the system SHALL generate actionable recommendations for process improvements
5. IF multiple retrospectives exist THEN the system SHALL identify trends and suggest systematic improvements

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing Commands

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want the new planning commands to integrate seamlessly with existing CCPlugins commands, so that I can maintain a smooth workflow without context switching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using planning commands THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant existing commands at appropriate workflow points
2. WHEN implementation begins THEN the system SHALL integrate with `/scaffold`, `/implement`, and `/test` commands
3. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL leverage `/review`, `/security-scan`, and `/predict-issues` commands
4. WHEN features are complete THEN the system SHALL suggest `/commit`, `/docs`, and `/contributing` commands
5. IF session continuity is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain state files compatible with existing command patterns

### Requirement 8: Test Coverage Expansion

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want a command to expand test coverage by analyzing existing tests and creating additional tests following the same patterns, so that I can improve code quality without manually writing repetitive test cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `/expand-tests [module-name]` THEN the system SHALL analyze existing test patterns and structure
2. WHEN expanding tests THEN the system SHALL identify untested code paths, edge cases, and error scenarios
3. WHEN creating new tests THEN the system SHALL follow the existing test style, naming conventions, and framework usage
4. WHEN tests are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure they integrate with existing test suites and build processes
5. IF no existing tests are found THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate testing frameworks and create initial test structure
6. WHEN expansion is complete THEN the system SHALL report coverage improvements and suggest additional testing strategies

### Requirement 9: Pattern Expansion Commands

**User Story:** As a software engineer, I want commands that can analyze existing working patterns and expand them to similar contexts, so that I can maintain consistency while scaling functionality efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `/expand-api [endpoint-pattern]` THEN the system SHALL analyze existing API patterns and create similar endpoints
2. WHEN I run `/expand-components [component-pattern]` THEN the system SHALL create similar UI components following established patterns
3. WHEN I run `/expand-models [model-pattern]` THEN the system SHALL create data models following existing schema patterns
4. WHEN expanding patterns THEN the system SHALL maintain naming conventions, error handling, and architectural consistency
5. WHEN patterns are expanded THEN the system SHALL update related documentation, tests, and integration points
6. IF pattern conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL highlight inconsistencies and suggest resolution approaches

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Knowledge Management
