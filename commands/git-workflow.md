# Git Workflow Optimization

I'll analyze and optimize your Git workflows, branching strategies, and collaboration processes to improve team productivity and code quality.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` - workflow focus, branch patterns, or team collaboration areas

## Session Intelligence

I'll maintain Git workflow optimization progress across sessions:

**Session Files (in current project directory):**
- `git-workflow/analysis.md` - Workflow optimization recommendations
- `git-workflow/state.json` - Workflow configuration and progress

**IMPORTANT:** Session files are stored in a `git-workflow` folder in your current project root

**Auto-Detection:**
- If session exists: Resume workflow optimization
- If no session: Create new workflow analysis
- Commands: `resume`, `analyze`, `optimize`

## Phase 1: Git Workflow Analysis

**MANDATORY FIRST STEPS:**
1. Check if `git-workflow` directory exists in current working directory
2. If directory exists, check for session files:
   - Look for `git-workflow/state.json`
   - Look for `git-workflow/analysis.md`
   - If found, resume from existing session
3. If no directory or session exists:
   - Analyze current Git repository structure and history
   - Identify workflow patterns and collaboration issues
   - Create comprehensive workflow optimization plan
4. Show Git workflow analysis preview before optimization

**Repository Analysis:**
- Use **Git commands** to analyze commit history and branch patterns
- Use **Read** to examine Git configuration and workflow documentation
- Use **Grep** to identify workflow patterns in commit messages and PR templates
- Analyze team collaboration patterns and merge strategies

## Phase 2: Branching Strategy Optimization

### Extended Thinking for Complex Git Workflows

For complex Git workflow scenarios, I'll use extended thinking:

<think>
When optimizing complex Git workflows:
- Multi-team collaboration with different release cycles and dependencies
- Monorepo vs polyrepo strategies and their workflow implications
- Advanced branching strategies for continuous deployment and feature flags
- Conflict resolution strategies for large teams and parallel development
- Release management and hotfix workflows for production systems
- Code review optimization and automated quality gates
- Git hook integration for automated testing and compliance checking
</think>

**Triggers for Extended Analysis:**
- Large teams with complex branching and merge patterns
- Multi-product repositories with different release schedules
- High-frequency deployment environments requiring advanced workflows
- Compliance requirements with audit trails and approval processes

I'll analyze and optimize your branching strategy:

**Branching Pattern Analysis:**
- **Git Flow**: Feature, develop, release, and hotfix branch analysis
- **GitHub Flow**: Simplified workflow with feature branches and main
- **GitLab Flow**: Environment-based branching with deployment stages
- **Custom Workflows**: Team-specific branching patterns and conventions

**Branch Management:**
- Branch naming convention optimization and enforcement
- Merge vs rebase strategy recommendations
- Branch protection rules and quality gates
- Automated branch cleanup and maintenance

## Phase 3: Merge Conflict Resolution

I'll provide intelligent merge conflict resolution strategies:

**Conflict Analysis:**
- Common conflict patterns and their root causes
- File-specific conflict resolution strategies
- Team collaboration patterns that reduce conflicts
- Automated conflict prevention and early detection

**Resolution Strategies:**
- Merge conflict resolution best practices and tools
- Three-way merge understanding and optimization
- Rebase workflow optimization for cleaner history
- Conflict resolution automation and tooling recommendations

## Phase 4: Commit History Optimization

I'll analyze and improve commit history quality:

**Commit Analysis:**
- Commit message quality and convention compliance
- Commit size and scope optimization recommendations
- Atomic commit strategies for better code review
- Commit history cleanup and organization

**History Improvement:**
- Interactive rebase strategies for history cleanup
- Squash and merge optimization for feature integration
- Commit message templates and automation
- Git hooks for commit quality enforcement

## Phase 5: Code Review Process Enhancement

I'll optimize code review workflows:

**Review Process Analysis:**
- Pull request template optimization and standardization
- Review assignment strategies and load balancing
- Review quality metrics and improvement recommendations
- Automated review assistance and quality checks

**Collaboration Enhancement:**
- **GitHub**: Pull request workflow optimization and automation
- **GitLab**: Merge request process improvement and integration
- **Bitbucket**: Code review enhancement and team collaboration
- **Azure DevOps**: Pull request policy optimization

## Phase 6: Release Management Automation

I'll streamline release processes:

**Release Workflow:**
- Semantic versioning implementation and automation
- Changelog generation from commit history
- Release branch management and deployment coordination
- Hotfix workflow optimization for production issues

**Automation Integration:**
- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow automation for releases and deployments
- **GitLab CI/CD**: Pipeline optimization for release management
- **Jenkins**: Build and deployment pipeline integration
- **Custom Scripts**: Release automation and notification systems

## Context Continuity

**Session Resume:**
When you return and run `/git-workflow` or `/git-workflow resume`:
- Load existing workflow analysis and optimization progress
- Show workflow improvements and remaining optimizations
- Continue optimization from last checkpoint
- Maintain all workflow configurations and recommendations

**Progress Example:**
```
RESUMING GIT WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION
├── Branch Strategy: Git Flow → GitHub Flow (simplified)
├── Merge Conflicts: 45% reduction (improved patterns)
├── Commit Quality: 78% conventional format compliance
├── Review Time: 2.3 days → 1.1 days average
└── Release Automation: 85% automated

Continuing workflow optimization...
```

## Practical Examples

**Start Git Workflow Optimization:**
```
/git-workflow                       # Complete workflow analysis
/git-workflow branches/             # Focus on branching strategy
/git-workflow --conflicts           # Analyze merge conflict patterns
/git-workflow --releases            # Optimize release management
```

**Session Management:**
```
/git-workflow resume      # Continue existing optimization
/git-workflow analyze     # Analyze current workflow patterns
/git-workflow optimize    # Apply workflow improvements
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

**Git Workflow Integration:**
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated quality checks
- Generate workflow documentation and team guidelines
- Monitor workflow metrics and team collaboration patterns
- Validate workflow improvements and team adoption

**Command Suggestions:**
Based on workflow analysis, I may suggest:
- `/contributing` - For team contribution guidelines
- `/architecture-analysis` - For repository structure optimization
- `/monitoring-setup` - For workflow metrics and monitoring

## Safety Guarantees

**Protection Measures:**
- Non-destructive workflow analysis with optional configuration
- Comprehensive backup recommendations before workflow changes
- Safe Git history modification with proper safeguards
- Team communication and training for workflow changes

**Important:** I will NEVER:
- Modify Git history without explicit approval and safeguards
- Force push to protected branches or shared repositories
- Delete branches without proper backup and verification
- Add AI attribution to Git commits or workflow configurations

## What I'll Actually Do

1. **Analyze comprehensively** - Current workflow patterns and collaboration issues
2. **Optimize systematically** - Branching strategies and merge processes
3. **Resolve intelligently** - Merge conflicts and history cleanup
4. **Enhance collaboration** - Code review processes and team workflows
5. **Automate effectively** - Release management and quality gates
6. **Monitor continuously** - Workflow metrics and team productivity

I'll maintain complete continuity between sessions, always resuming exactly where we left off with full context of Git workflow analysis and optimization progress.
